# Python - Everything is an Object

In this project, we delve deeper into how Python works with different types of objects. Understanding the concept that everything is an object, we explore scenarios where variables may be modified unintentionally. We examine the distinction between mutable and immutable objects, aliasing, assignment, and references.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

+ What is an object
+ The difference between a class and an object or instance
+ The difference between immutable and mutable objects
+ What is a reference
+ What is an assignment
+ What is an alias
+ How to determine if two variables are identical
+ How to determine if two variables are linked to the same object
+ How to display the variable identifier (memory address in CPython implementation)
+ The concepts of mutable and immutable
+ Built-in mutable types
+ Built-in immutable types
+ How Python passes variables to functions
